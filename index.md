# **SLR and Social Vulnerability**

## **MOTIVATION**

### **URGENCY** <br>
There is an urgent need for adaptation responses to sea level rise (SLR) that ensure equitable futures for all communities.

### **UNCERTAINTY** <br>
Uncertainty of SLR projections complicates the assessment of associated vulnerabilities, risks, and potential impacts.

### **UNDERSTANDING** <br>
Discrepancies between data sources and scarcity of localized projections hinder effective translation of science into policy and plans.


Sea levels are rising globally due to climate change and are projected to rise at an increasing
rate. However, sea-level rise (SLR) is not a phenomenon that impacts places uniformly. The seas are rising much faster in some regions than in others, while some places are expecting sea levels to fall. Consequently, the impacts are not equally distributed and some sub-populations face greater vulnerability due to differences in socio-demographic characteristics (Marino, 2018). 

Recent vulnerability and risk assessment models show low-income communities and communities of color are often disproportionately affected by coastal flooding events and have less capacity to adapt or recover after natural disasters. (Hardy and Hauer, 2019)

According to California’s Legislative Analysts Office (LAO):
- Between $8 billion and $10 billion of existing property in California is likely to be underwater by 2050, with an additional $6 billion to $10 billion at risk during high tides.
- Four feet of higher water levels would cause daily flooding for nearly 28,000 socially vulnerable residents in the San Francisco Bay Area region.

Simultaneously, the critical infrastructure these communities rely on is under increasing stress. Hard armoring structures such as seawalls and revetments have been the typical historical response to coastal erosion but will not be effective over the long term. Adaptation approaches are very costly (Griggs and Patsch, 2020; LAO, 2020), and because the most severe effects of SLR will be felt decades from now, taking actions to address them now may seem less urgent than immediate challenges facing cities.

## **RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

We are interested in exploring the relationship between NASA-generated sea-level rise projections, the localized information planners in California use to make land-use decisions, and the potential impacts the difference between these projections may have on vulnerable communities and state budget allocation for infrastructure and adaptation measures.

Our inspiration for this comes from “Bay Shoreline Flood Explorer,” <link> an interactive online tool created by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's (BCDC) Adapting to Rising Tides Program. 

1. What is the difference between most recent NASA-generated SLR SLR projections and those projections that are currently used by local planners to inform planning decisions? 
2. What is the difference in potential impacts on vulnerable communities between these two SLR estimations? 
3. What is the difference in potential impacts on critical infrasture between these two SLR estimations? 
4. What are the economic implications of this difference on local and state-wide funding allocations for adaptation? 

## **APPROACH and METHODOLOGY**

This project was completed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks and Excel. Data was downloaded as CSV, shapefile, or loaded into the notebook through an API. Python packages that were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data are listed below. 

In the research process, we discovered the limitations of the data and our abilities in Python.  We were unable to meaningfully answer the research questions above, but used this as an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the tools. What follows is our process, limitations, areas for improvement, and further research opportunities.

- Census-tract level data for the Social Vulnerability Index

## **DATA ANALYSIS and MAPPING**

The primary data set that instigated this inquiry was Dr. Daniella Hirshfeld’s recent survey of Global Sea Level Rise Practitioners.  Respondents were asked to report the SLR projections they use in planning documents for 2050 and 2100. Questionnaire results were reported by specific location (i.e. nation, state, city, etc), not by individual respondents. There were 248 responses from 18 nations, and six continents. Of the 248 responses, 179 use guidance that addresses future SLR, the other 69 do not. The second level of data cleaning scoped responses down to the United States, and then to California.

Once we refined the data to the state of California (n= 21), we took a closer look at the detailed responses. There at least five ways of structuring SLR data (see below), and they were all represented in the small subset of Califonia responses. To clean the data so that we could report local "low's" and "high's", we had to make choices as to which "low's" and "high's" to include. We decided to
