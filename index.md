# **SLR and Social Vulnerability**

## **MOTIVATION**

### **URGENCY** <br>
There is an urgent need for adaptation responses to sea level rise (SLR) that ensure equitable futures for all communities.

### **UNCERTAINTY** <br>
Uncertainty of SLR projections complicates the assessment of associated vulnerabilities, risks, and potential impacts.

### **UNDERSTANDING** <br>
Discrepancies between data sources and scarcity of localized projections hinder effective translation of science into policy and plans.

## **CONTEXT**

Sea levels are rising globally due to climate change and are projected to rise at an increasing
rate. However, sea-level rise (SLR) is not a phenomenon that impacts places uniformly. The seas are rising much faster in some regions than in others, while some places are expecting sea levels to fall. Consequently, the impacts are not equally distributed and some sub-populations face greater vulnerability due to differences in socio-demographic characteristics (Marino, 2018). 

Recent vulnerability and risk assessment models show low-income communities and communities of color are often disproportionately affected by coastal flooding events and have less capacity to adapt or recover after natural disasters. (Hardy and Hauer, 2019)

According to California’s Legislative Analysts Office (LAO):
- Between $8 billion and $10 billion of existing property in California is likely to be underwater by 2050, with an additional $6 billion to $10 billion at risk during high tides.
- Four feet of higher water levels would cause daily flooding for nearly 28,000 socially vulnerable residents in the San Francisco Bay Area region.

Simultaneously, the critical infrastructure these communities rely on is under increasing stress. Hard armoring structures such as seawalls and revetments have been the typical historical response to coastal erosion but will not be effective over the long term. Adaptation approaches are very costly (Griggs and Patsch, 2020; LAO, 2020), and because the most severe effects of SLR will be felt decades from now, taking actions to address them now may seem less urgent than immediate challenges facing cities.

## **RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

We are interested in exploring the relationship between NASA-generated sea-level rise projections, the localized information planners in California use to make land-use decisions, and the potential impacts the difference between these projections may have on vulnerable communities and state budget allocation for infrastructure and adaptation measures.

Our inspiration for this comes from “Bay Shoreline Flood Explorer,” <link> an interactive online tool created by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's (BCDC) Adapting to Rising Tides Program. 

1. What is the difference between most recent NASA-generated SLR SLR projections and those projections that are currently used by local planners to inform planning decisions? 
2. What is the difference in potential impacts on vulnerable communities between these two SLR estimations? 
3. What is the difference in potential impacts on critical infrasture between these two SLR estimations? 
4. What are the economic implications of this difference on local and state-wide funding allocations for adaptation? 

## **APPROACH and METHODOLOGY**

This project was completed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks and Excel. Data was downloaded as CSV, shapefile, or loaded into the notebook through an API. Python packages that were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data are listed below. 

In the research process, we discovered the limitations of the data and our abilities in Python.  We were unable to meaningfully answer the research questions above, but used this as an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the tools. What follows is our process, limitations, areas for improvement, and further research opportunities.

### Datasets
- Novel data set from Dr. Daniella Hirschfeld at Utah State University: “Global Sea Level Practitioner Survey”
- SLR projections from NASA’s Sea Level Rise Scenario Tool
- Census-tract level data for the Social Vulnerability Index

### Limtations
The main limitation to integrating the data sets were the different spatial resolutions and data types. 
1. **The survey data is spatially categorized by Nation > State > City.** Additionally, the lat/lon coordinates of the where the respondent filled out the survey does not always match the jurisdictional unit they are responsible for. For example, the respondent for Hayward was near Monterey and the respondent for Marin City was in Santa Rosa. We had to manually enter the correct lat/lon for Hayward, Marin City, and Alameda.
2. **NASA data is geolocated to 12 California tide gauges.** The lat/lon of those tide gauges did not neatly map to the responses, so we had to manually match the closest tide gauge to the the city response. For example, we used data from Port Chicago in the Suisun Bay (part of the northeastern Bay Delta) to compare with Marin City.
3. **SVI data is at the Census-tract level and is difficult to organize by City.** We attempted to pull all the fips codes within the cities we had survey data for, but the outcome was uninformative. 

The second key limitation was our technical _inability_ to work with shapefiles. 
1. SVI and GIS data from [USGS Our Coast Our Future](https://ourcoastourfuture.org/) are both available in shapfiles. However working with that data was well-beyond our technical ability. 
2. We had difficulty embedding a popup with SLR information on an SVI coropleth map. 


## **DATA ANALYSIS and MAPPING**

### Cleaning the data
The primary data set that instigated this inquiry was Dr. Daniella Hirshfeld’s recent survey of Global Sea Level Rise Practitioners.  Respondents were asked to report the SLR projections they use in planning documents for 2050 and 2100. Questionnaire results were reported by specific location (i.e. nation, state, city, etc), not by individual respondents. There were 248 responses from 18 nations, and six continents. Of the 248 responses, 179 use guidance that addresses future SLR, the other 69 do not. The second level of data cleaning scoped responses down to the United States and then to California.

### Exploring the data

Once we refined the data to the state of California (n= 21), we took a closer look at the detailed responses. Of 21 responses, only 16 used SLR guidance in planning. Of 16, only 9 cities were within 25 miles of tide gauges NASA used for their projections. Of those, 5 cities were in the Bay Area. So, we ultimately rescoped our project to just the Bay Area. As detailed below, rescoping wasn't a linear process. As one member of the team was working on SLR information, the other was working on SVI... we iterated as we attemepted to merge these different data sets.

#### SLR Reporting Structure

The survey listed five structures that SLR could be reported (see below), and each one was represented in the small subset of Califonia responses. To clean the data so that we could compare local "low's" and "high's", we had to make choices as to which "low's" and "high's" to include. We agggregated the low values for each structure and the high value for each structure, but ommitted the "extreme high" because recent studies suggest those projections are too extreme (REFERENCE NEEDED).

#### Practitioner SLR information - California and Local

After aggregating the projections, we mapped the responses. However, of the 16 "yes" responses, we were only able to use 9 points that mapped to cities that were within 25 miles of NASA tide gauges.

Additionally, NASA's projections included a fifth SLR reporting structure: Observed Extrapolation, Low, Intermediate Low, Intermediate, Intermediate High, and High. At attempts for consistency, we took the "Low" and "Intermediate High" for each location to compare to the values reported by survey respondents. What we see from this data is that survey responses are, in general, much more conservative in their estimates (i.e. planning for higher SLR) than NASA's projections.

For example, San Francisco uses a low estimate of X and a high estimate of X for 2050. NASA projects X and X respectively. The difference for 2100 is even more extreme.

We can see similar differences in just what practitioners in the Bay Area reported.

#### SLR information x Social Vulnerability Index
To look at social vulnerability, we began by pulling U.S. Census 5-year ACS through their API, but ran into the challenge of determining which characterisitics to include for vulnerability. For ease and accuracy, we abandoned the Census and downloaded census tract level data from the [Social Vulnerability Index](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html). 

The Social Vulnerability Index uses U.S. Census data to determine the relative social vulnerability of every census tract. The SVI ranks each tract on 15 social factors and groups them into four related themes. Each tract receives a separate ranking for each of the four themes, as well as an overall ranking. The CDC/ATSDR SVI is a database that helps emergency response planners and public health officials identify, map, and plan support for communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a public health emergency. 

We thought we could use these shapefiles to construct an SVI basemap and overlay SLR projections. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, our ambition exceeded our abilities, and we ultimately used CSV files to map SVI. 

The other challenge we faced was inconsistencies in spatial resolution. We only have useable data for 9 cities along California's coast. Of those, five are in the bay area. When we mapped SVI for all 9 cities, the result was not legible or informative, so we rescoped this ananlysis to just Bay Area Counties.
